            <p class="mainDes">	Meet Rene Ramirez, he is currently the Community Outreach Coordinator at 42 Silicon Valley. <br>Rene Ramirez joined 42 Silicon Valley (42) in 2016 as a student, over the last 4 years he volunteered and transitioned into the position he is in now.
                <br>
                <br>His journey began when he dropped out of San Francisco State University. His first 2 years at 42 were as a student, he had to prove himself that he was capable of being a strong candidate to become a student. <br>His rigorous path while sleeping in his car for 28 days finally paid off when he joined in as a full time student in 2017. 
                <br>
                <br>In late 2017 42 asked him to join their team as an Event Coordinator after his experience with volunteering around campus for several months. <br>Over the next 2 years he managed over 200 events and shared some unique experiences with huge companies and people worldwide. In 2020 he was promoted into his current position as a Community Outreach Coordinator.
